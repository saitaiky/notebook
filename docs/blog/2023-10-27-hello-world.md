Hi, welcome to my blog. This page is intended to explain the intension and information of this blog.

## Intention

I've been writing notes and blogs for different topics that I am interested into like software development, AI, traveling and music in various platforms. I do want to have a place to organise these knownledge and thoughts; especially, I have been working as an web engineer and architect for 10 years in 2022.  The second goal I want to achieve is having a platform that I can use MarkDown to run and deploy without any hosting cost and data schema blinded to a platform. Luckily, I found [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - an amazing product created by Facebook team.

## Reader 

In this blog, the primary audience is for myself. It serves as a repository for my study notes, reflections, and ideas. Our minds are a treasure trove of thoughts and experiences, but human memory is famously fallible. To ensure the preservation of knowledge and insights, I've chosen the written word. Plus, writing provides the opportunity to revisit and validate what I've learned, and it's a powerful tool for organizing and expressing thoughts coherently. 

I firmly believe in the idea of taking from society and giving back. If the ideas and notes I share here prove valuable to you, please don't hesitate to use and share them.  I encourage you to retain the authorship information when you do. After all, sharing knowledge is one of the most impactful ways to contribute to our collective wisdom.

## Adapt and adjust

:::infoSurvival of the fittest
Charles Darwin's quote, "It is not the strongest of the species that survives; nor the most intelligent; it is the one most responsive to change," emphasizes the importance of adaptability and flexibility in the process of evolution. This idea, often paraphrased as "survival of the fittest," doesn't imply that physical strength or intellectual prowess alone guarantee survival. Instead, it underscores that the species most capable of adapting to changing environmental conditions and challenges has a better chance of survival.

This website's core message is encapsulated in "Adapt and Adjust." In today's fast-paced world and evolving society, Darwin's principle of adaptability continues to be profoundly relevant.

- In a rapidly changing job market, individuals who continuously update their skills and adapt to new technologies and trends are more likely to thrive. Lifelong learning is essential.
- Successful businesses must adapt to changing consumer preferences, market dynamics, and emerging technologies. Companies that embrace change and innovation are more likely to succeed.
- As humans, our belief systems are in a constant state of evolution. Concepts like human rights, gender equality, freedom of religion, and media portrayals of social classes are continually reshaped by societal progress. To approach these changes with a philosophical mindset, allowing room for critique and reflection, is essential for maintaining rationality.
    - In today's world, media often simplifies complex issues into binary oppositions. However, true adaptation doesn't solely involve passively accepting incoming information. It also entails the ability to critically analyze and evolve one's beliefs based on personal insights and reflections.

In essence, Darwin's wisdom teaches us that, those who embrace change, learn from it, and adjust accordingly are more likely to thrive and succeed in an ever-evolving world.

## Future

After a year of effort (as of October 2023), most of the articles that I posted here answer the question of How and what. In 2024, I want to focus more on thoughts and ideas and creating some side projects to showcase in AI and Crypto.
