## Enterprise Architect

Enterprise architects have the most overarching view of the organization and know of its capabilities and potentials. They play a key role when it comes to identifying business needs in context with external factors like competitors and internal factors like a company’s IT landscape. They are in charge of analyzing current trends in technology architecture and educating technology departments about new frameworks and best practices.

Through the use of clear architectural models and the help of domain architects, they define business goals and design **an information technology roadmap**. This roadmap is supposed to create a bridge between context and concept.

## Solution architects 

Solution architects are responsible for finding and implementing solutions for specific business problems. The solution architect bridges the gap between concept and implementation by acting as a channel between enterprise architecture and technical architecture. They translate the design into a concept for IT operations.

Solution Architects are most similar to **project managers**, ensuring that all parties, including stakeholders, are on the same page and moving in the right direction at all stages.


## Technical Architect

Technical architects manage all activities leading to the successful implementation of a new application. They are specialists in their field and must be able to first visualize new technical concepts and then implement them into an existing system.

They focus on a specific technology and provide the technological know-how required to deliver the product. It is their responsibility to implement the IT project with a development team, defining best practices and standards. In addition, they inform all those involved about specific software requirements and the associated risks. Ideally, the technical architects are experienced in dealing with local and cloud-based infrastructures and know how to use an application most effectively.

:::note
Most technical architecture specialists focus on one single implementation and specialize in a particular domain where they also define best practices.

The technical architect’s main task is to realize particular technical implementation processes. As this requires a high level of in-depth expertise, technical architects usually specialize in one single technology. Thus, they are named according to their area of knowledge, for example, Java or Python architect. Just like data, application, or information architects, technical architects fall under the umbrella of domain architects.
