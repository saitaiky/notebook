## Parathread

Technically they are the same as parachains but differ from the latter by the economic model. 

Parathreads use a pay as you go model and pay for each block to be validated by the relay chain 

That is during times of high network congestion para threads can become quite expensive to use and during times of low activity the fees on them are low. 

The polkadot network can hold up to 10,000 Parathreads

## Substrate

The polkadot network itself was built by using substrate, but building parachains using substrate is not at all a prerequisite and vice versa. Blockchains with substrate can exist on their own without connecting to polkadot or kusama
