Well, when we look at the overview formation of a DApp, we see that the singular data center is removed. Instead, a DAPP (Decentralized Application) consists of back-end code that runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

## DApp Problem solving statement  

> Cut out the middleman

So Uber is an application, but essentially it acts as a middleman. You have a delivery person and these drivers are doing the actual service. Uber essentially acts as a middleman, which connects the drivers to the customers.

Imagine that when you pay for something such as a food delivery service like Uber, you no longer have to pay the company and all those extra fees, and instead you can pay the delivery person directly.

DEXs are an excellent example of that. Like trading on Uniswap versus trading on Coinbase.

##  How does A DApp fundamentally work

> No one single authority can control the network

Block chain digital ledger of transactions that get duplicated across an entire network.

This provides a secure way for individuals to directly deal with each other, right directly deal with each other without a central point of authority, be it a bank, government or application or executive

- Data and records must be public
- Secure network with cryptographic tokens
- Must have open source fundamental 

These are the general beliefs of the blockchain communities. And although many DApps may have some form of combination, if not all of these features.


## What is A Dpp

- Protective against Censorship
  Decentralization enables a shield aginst any single point of failure. No one authority can manipulate or gain control of data and information and censor information.
- Downtime resistance
- DeFI Intergratable 
  DeFi is an integratable solution much easier when it comes to DApp than it would with APP.
- Open source
  Developers can build better systems and make sidespread improvement through open source visbility. 



## DApp Vulnerablitlities 

- Open Source Hacks
  Public visibility provides bad actors more leverage, therefore, to look for and exploit weaknesses.
- Web2 & The network effect
  The current users compared to Web two, are low, rendering them less interactive and lower network effect often can be tied as well to the DApps overall security
- The less user interaction
  The less user database information, the easier it may be computationally for bad actors to take advantage.
