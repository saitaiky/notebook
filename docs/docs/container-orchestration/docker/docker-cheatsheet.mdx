# See full command of running/stopped container in Docker

```bash
docker inspect -f "{{.Name}} {{.Config.Cmd}}" $(docker ps -a -q)
```

# Simple method to run docker or docker-compose with the same UID/GID as parent user

That is useful when you mount a volumn via docker-compose. You need to align the UID and GID from host to docker container, so that it can create folders to host system and have the permission to access the folder.

```bash
UID=$(id -u) GID=$(id -g) docker-compose up

```

# Communication between multiple docker-compose projects

In this example, each container can look up the hostname front or api and get back the appropriate container’s IP address. For example, front’s application code could connect to the URL `htpp://api:8888` and start using the Postgres database.

> Note: Your app’s network is given a name based on the “project name”, which is based on the name of the directory it lives in, in this case a prefix front_ was added in front folder 

```yml
# front/docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  front:
    ...
    networks:
      - some-net
networks:
  some-net:
    driver: bridge


# api/docker-compose.yml
version: '2'
services:
  api:
    ...
    networks:
      - front_some-net
    ports:
      - "8080:8888"
networks:
  front_some-net:
    external: true
```
