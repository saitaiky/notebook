Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It enables users to define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources in a declarative and version-controlled manner. With Terraform, you can create, modify, or delete various cloud, on-premises, or third-party service resources using a configuration file. This approach enhances efficiency and consistency in infrastructure management, as changes are automatically applied to maintain the desired state. Terraform supports multiple cloud providers, making it a versatile choice for automating infrastructure deployments, whether it's for virtual machines, networking, databases, or other components, across different cloud platforms.
