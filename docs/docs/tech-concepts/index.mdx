To become a good system or solution architect in software development, consider the following steps:
- Gain Technical Expertise: Build a solid foundation in software development principles, programming languages, frameworks, and architecture patterns. Stay updated with industry trends and emerging technologies relevant to your domain.
- Understand Business Requirements: Develop a deep understanding of the business goals and objectives. Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and analyze their needs, aligning technical solutions with business requirements.
- Think Holistically: Take a holistic approach to system design by considering various aspects such as scalability, performance, security, reliability, maintainability, and integration. Design solutions that are flexible, adaptable, and aligned with long-term business strategies.
- Communication and Collaboration: Effectively communicate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Collaborate with developers, product owners, and project managers to ensure alignment and understanding of the architectural vision.
- Problem Solving and Decision Making: Analyze complex problems, identify potential solutions, and evaluate trade-offs. Make informed decisions based on technical feasibility, business impact, and risk assessment. Continuously evaluate and refine architectural decisions throughout the software development lifecycle.
- Documentation and Visualization: Create clear and concise architectural documentation that captures the design decisions, rationale, and system components. Utilize visual diagrams, models, and notations to communicate the architecture effectively.
- Continual Learning and Improvement: Stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends, technologies, and best practices. Seek opportunities to expand your knowledge, attend conferences, participate in communities, and engage in continuous learning. Reflect on past experiences and strive for continuous improvement.
- Leadership and Mentoring: Provide guidance and mentorship to junior architects and development teams. Foster a collaborative and inclusive environment that encourages learning, innovation, and knowledge sharing.
- Embrace Agility: Embrace agile methodologies and principles to adapt to changing requirements and deliver value incrementally. Foster a culture of experimentation, feedback, and continuous improvement.

Becoming a good system or solution architect requires a combination of technical expertise, business acumen, effective communication, and leadership skills. It is an ongoing journey of learning, practice, and refinement. This blog is intended to record the journey of how to be good in this area.

## Learn from genesis

Below are some approaches that how the great technical people to learn new thing in tech. 

- Learning K8s with only command lines and API docs with out Googling. This approach is inspired by [Kelsey hightower
/Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
- How [Bret Fisher](https://www.bretfisher.com/) study K8s
    - I'm going to be starting with the documentation with the samples. Also, using the generated YAML from the command line using the `kubectl create`. 
    - Then, I'm going to start using these other scratch commands to fill in my gaps and to understand new fields that I should put into my resource and to make it do what I need it to do.
