Identity Federation is the process of delegating authentication to a trusted external party, where one party acts as the Identity Provider (IdP) responsible for user authentication and the other as the Service Provider (SP) delivering services to users. In this system, the SP trusts the IdP's authentication. It's commonly used with systems like WSO2 Identity Server and allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials, improving user experience and enabling advanced identity management features like multi-factor authentication.
