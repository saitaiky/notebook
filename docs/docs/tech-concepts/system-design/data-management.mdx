This article is to answer the question of - How to maintain data consistency and implement queries?
- Database per Service - each service has its own private database 
- Saga - use sagas, which a sequences of local transactions, to maintain data consistency across services
- CQRS - implement queries by maintaining one or more materialized views that can be efficiently queried
- Event sourcing - persist aggregates as a sequence of events

## Database per service

The service’s database is effectively part of the implementation of that service. It cannot be accessed directly by other services.

There are a few different ways to keep a service’s persistent data private. You do not need to provision a database server for each service. For example, if you are using a relational database then the options are:
- Private-tables-per-service – each service owns a set of tables that must only be accessed by that service
- Schema-per-service – each service has a database schema that’s private to that service
- Database-server-per-service – each service has it’s own database server.

### Benefits
- Helps ensure that the services are loosely coupled. Changes to one service’s database does not impact any other services.
- Each service can use the type of database that is best suited to its needs. For example, a service that does text searches could use **ElasticSearch**. A service that manipulates a social graph could use **Neo4j**c.

### Drawbacks
- Implementing business transactions that span multiple services is not straightforward. Distributed transactions are best avoided because of the CAP theorem. Moreover, many modern (NoSQL) databases don’t support them.
- Implementing queries that join data that is now in multiple databases is challenging.
- Complexity of managing multiple SQL and NoSQL databases

There are various patterns/solutions for implementing transactions and queries that span services:

- Implementing queries that span services:
- Implementing transactions that span services - use the [Saga pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html).
- [API Composition](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/api-composition.html) - the application performs the join rather than the database. For example, a service (or the API gateway) could retrieve a customer and their orders by first retrieving the customer from the customer service and then querying the order service to return the customer’s most recent orders.
- [Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html) - maintain one or more materialized views that contain data from multiple services. The views are kept by services that subscribe to events that each services publishes when it updates its data. For example, the online store could implement a query that finds customers in a particular region and their recent orders by maintaining a view that joins customers and orders. The view is updated by a service that subscribes to customer and order events.


## Event sourcing

The event sourcing pattern is typically used with the **CQRS pattern** to **decouple read from write workloads**, and optimize for performance, scalability, and security. Data is stored as a series of events, instead of directli storing the current state to data stores. Microservices replay events from an event store to compute the appropriate state of their own data stores. 

:::note
Events represent the state transitions of things that have occurred in your system. 
:::

The pattern provides visibility for the current state of the application and additional context for how the application arrived at that state. The event sourcing pattern works effectively with the **CQRS pattern** because data can be reproduced for a specific event, even if the command and query data stores have different schemas.

By choosing this pattern, you can **identify and reconstruct the application’s state** for any point in time. This produces a persistent audit trail and makes debugging easier. However, data eventually becomes consistent and this might not be appropriate for some use cases.

### Event Sourcing Architecture

Event Sourcing is an architectural design pattern that stores data in an append-only log. It is part of a wider ecosystem of design patterns that work together in various ways to allow developers to create the most effective architecture for their needs. 

By deploying an Event Store as a design pattern within a wider architecture, it allows for the inclusion of other design patterns in the system that are the most suitable for the needs of the domain. For example, an event-sourced system works well within a CQRS architecture, however it's not necessary to use them together. **Event Sourcing can be deployed alongside event driven architecture, or in conjunction with CQRS, an aggregate pattern, a command handler pattern, or one of many other patterns.**
Each individual pattern is a useful tool on its own, that can work in concert with other related patterns to make stronger, more specific patterns for your specific use case.

An event store can be a key element of a system, and that system can be as simple or as complex as the business domain requires it to be. It's useful to consider putting an event-sourced system in a part of the architecture that requires the preservation of context for all events, as this is where Event Sourcing is most effective. 


### AWS implimentation

This pattern can be implemented by using either **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams or Amazon EventBridge**.

#### Amazon Kinesis Data Streams implementation

In the following illustration, Kinesis Data Streams is the main component of a centralized event store. The event store captures application changes as events and persists them on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

#### Amazon EventBridge implementation

In the following illustration, EventBridge is used as an event store. EventBridge provides a [default event bus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-event-bus.html) for events that are published by AWS services, and you can also create a [custom event bus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/create-event-bus.html) for domain-specific buses.

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

You have applied the Microservices architecture pattern and the Database per service pattern. As a result, it is no longer straightforward to implement queries that join data from multiple services. Also, if you have applied the Event sourcing pattern then the data is no longer easily queried.

### Problem

How to implement a query that retrieves data from multiple services in a microservice architecture?

### Solution

Define a view database, which is a read-only replica that is designed to support that query. The application keeps the replica up to data by subscribing to Domain events published by the service that own the data.

You can use the CQRS pattern to separate updates and queries if they have different requirements for throughput, latency, or consistency. The CQRS pattern splits the application into two parts: the **command side** and the **query side** (the same definition that is used by Meyer in Command and Query Separation, a command is any method that mutates state and a query is any method that returns a value). 
- The command side handles `create`, `update`, and `delete` requests. 
- The query side runs the `query` part by using the read replicas.

**CQRS**

**AWS implementation**

Source: [CQRS pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/modernization-data-persistence/cqrs-pattern.html)

You should consider using this pattern if:
- You implemented the database-per-service pattern and want to join data from multiple microservices.
- Your read and write workloads have separate requirements for scaling, latency, and consistency.
- Eventual consistency is acceptable for the read queries.

:::caution Important
The CQRS pattern typically results in **eventual consistency** between the data stores.

## Sega pattern

The saga pattern is **a failure management pattern** that helps establish consistency in distributed applications, and coordinates transactions between multiple microservices to maintain data consistency. A microservice publishes an event for every transaction, and the next transaction is initiated based on the event's outcome. It can take two different paths, depending on the success or failure of the transactions.

### Why is this a failure management pattern?
In a distributed transaction, multiple services can be called before a transaction is completed. When the services store data in different data stores, it can be challenging to maintain data consistency across these data stores.

To maintain consistency in a transaction, relational databases provide **two-phase commit (2PC)**. This consists of a prepare phase and a commit phase. 
1. In the prepare phase, the coordinating process requests the transaction’s participating processes (participants) to promise to commit or rollback the transaction. 
2. In the commit phase, the coordinating process requests the participants to commit the transaction. If the participants cannot agree to commit in the prepare phase, then the transaction is rolled back.

In distributed systems architected with microservices, **two-phase commit** is not an option as the transaction is distributed across various databases. In this case, one solution is to use **the saga pattern**.

:::info Example
For example, let’s imagine that you are building an e-commerce store where customers have a credit limit. The application must ensure that a new order will not exceed the customer’s credit limit. Since Orders and Customers are in different databases owned by different services the application cannot simply use a local ACID transaction.
:::

### How to implement it?
Implement each business transaction that spans multiple services is a saga. A saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes a message or event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga. If a local transaction fails because it violates a business rule then the saga executes a series of compensating transactions that undo the changes that were made by the preceding local transactions.

There are two ways of coordination sagas:
- **Choreography** - each local transaction publishes domain events that trigger local transactions in other services
- **Orchestration** - an orchestrator (object) tells the participants what local transactions to execute 

### Choreography strategy

Choreography is the simplest way to implement SAGA pattern. Each local transaction in chain is independent as they don’t have direct knowledge of each other. **If your distributed transaction only includes from 2 to 4 local transactions then Choreography is very fit option.** But having too many local transactions will make tracking which services listen to which events becomes very complex.

AWS EventBridge can help provide a choreography-based implementation of sagas

### Orchestration strategy

- Easy to maintain the whole workflow in one place — Orchestrator.
- Avoid cyclic dependencies between services. All services only communicate with Orchestrator.
- The complexity of transaction remains linear when new steps are added.

AWS Step Functions can help provide an orchestration-style implementation of sagas

### Why the hybrid approach is bad

I love using events to integrate different services together in a loosely-coupled way. But I think it’s a bad idea when it’s done inside the same bounded context because **the workflow doesn’t exist as a standalone concept** that is explicitly captured and source controlled.

In these choreographed workflows, the workflow only exists as the sum of loosely connected functions. This makes them very difficult to reason about and debug. And there’s no easy way to implement even simple things like workflow level timeouts, or even task level tasks for that matter (e.g. timeout the order if the restaurant doesn’t accept or reject the order within 10 minutes).

If this is what you have today, you should consider moving these workflows to Step Functions instead.

But, between bounded contexts, I’ll publish and **subscribe to events through SNS/EventBridge/Kinesis**, etc. This is so that different parts of the larger system can stay loosely coupled and only build on each other’s events and can evolve and fail independently.
