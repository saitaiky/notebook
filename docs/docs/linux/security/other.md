Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a physical device designed to provide secure and tamper-resistant storage for cryptographic keys and perform cryptographic operations. HSMs are used to generate, store, and manage encryption keys, digital signatures, and other cryptographic functions in a highly secure and isolated environment. They offer protection against unauthorized access and tampering, making them ideal for applications that require the highest level of security and compliance, such as financial transactions, digital signatures, and certificate management.
