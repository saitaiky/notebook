## HTTP VS TCP


The short answer: TCP is a transport-layer protocol, and HTTP is an application-layer protocol that runs over TCP. Keep reading for the long answer.

To understand the difference (and a lot of other networking topics), you need to understand the idea of a layered networking model. Essentially, there are different protocols that let a computer talk at different distances and different layers of abstraction.

At the very bottom of the network stack is the **physical layer**. This is where electrical signals or light pulses or radio waves actually transmit information from place to place. The physical layer doesn't really have protocols, but instead has standards for voltages, frequencies, and other physical properties. You can transmit information directly this way, but you need a lot of power or a dedicated line, and without higher layers you won't be able to share bandwidth.

The next layer up is the link layer. This layer covers communication with devices that share a physical communications medium. Here, protocols like Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n, and Token Ring specify how to handle multiple concurrent accesses to the physical medium and how to direct traffic to one device instead of another. In a typical home network, this is how your computer talks to your home "router."

The third layer is the **network layer**. In the majority of cases, this is dominated by Internet Protocol (IP). This is where the magic of the Internet happens, and you get to talk to a computer halfway around the world, without needing to know where it is. Routers handle directing your traffic from your local network to the network where the other computer lives, where its own link layer handles getting the packets to the right computer.

Now we are getting somewhere. We can talk to a computer somewhere around the world, but that computer is running lots of different programs. How should it know which one to deliver your message to? The transport layer takes care of this, usually with port numbers. The two most popular transport layer protocols are **TCP and UDP**. TCP does a lot of interesting things to smooth over the rough spots of network-layer packet-switched communication like reordering packets, retransmitting lost packets, etc. UDP is more unreliable, but has less overhead.

So we've connected your browser to the web server software on the other end, but how does the server know what page you want? How can you post a question or an answer? These are things that application-layer protocols handle. For web traffic, this is the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). There are thousands of application-layer protocols: 
- SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 for email; 
- XMPP, IRC, ICQ for chat; 
- Telnet, SSH, RDP for remote administration; etc.

These are the five layers of the **TCP/IP** networking model, but they are really only conceptual. The OSI model has 7 layers. In reality, some protocols shim between various layers, or can work at multiple layers at once. **TLS/SSL** for instance provides encryption and session information between the network and transport layers. Above the application layer, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) govern communication with web applications like Quora, Twitter, and Facebook.

## UDP and TCP/IP

### Differences

![udp-tcp](/img/linux/network/udp-tcp.jpg)
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks. It's used by other protocols FTP, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPs, Telnet. 
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP) refers to a protocol used for communication throughout the internet. It is specifically chosen for time-sensitive applications like gaming, playing videos, or Domain Name System (DNS) lookups. It's used by TFTP, SNMP, DNS, DHCP, RIP, VOIP.

#### UDP advantages
- small packet sizes than TCP by about 60%
- UDP header 20 bytes
- TCP header 80 bytes
- Connectionless: No connection to create and maintain
- You dont have to create connection first before sending out data
- You have more control of when data is being sent out
#### UDP disadvantages
- Data corruption is a common occurance on the Internet, UDP has a primitive form of error detection.
- No compensation for lost packets
- Packets can arrive out of order
- No congestion control
Conclusion: UDP may be light weight, but not that reliable.

#### TCP advantages
1. Retransmission - When a sender doesnt get an acknowlegement after a certain period of time, it will assume that the packet got lost on its way. So, it will send it again-.
2. In-order delivery - Because segments are ordered in TCP, it implements in-order delivery.
Although packets may come out of order, TCP rearranges them before sending them to application.
3. Congestion Control - Delays transmission when the network is congested
4. Error Detection

#### TCP disadvantages
- Bigger header and overhead
- Data doesnt always sent out immeditaley
- side effect of congestion control
- Hence real time conversation will not feel real time as you wanted to be
- As you can see, congestion control can be a nuisance or an enhancemewnt
- Retransmission of packets, acknowledgement of packets
- For example, to send HD video, you need lots of bandwidth. But if you are using TCP, you need more becaue of retransmission and acknowledgement. Hence, in this case it makes sense to use UDP than TCP.

### When to use which?

As the TCP internet protocol suite is non-proprietary and offers reliable full-duplex connections with TCP Streams, 3-way handshake, credit flow control, fast retransmission and recovery, Selective-ACK, and scaling it is compatible with all operating systems available in the global market, as well as it is also compatible with all types of computer hardware and networks. This, in turn, generates huge opportunities for various players in the global market to adopt TCP internet protocol suite.

The UDP reduces the requirement of computer resources, thus, lowering the overhead, which results in high usage over small networks for multicast or broadcast of real-time packets transmissions. This is expected to create demand for small-scale networks over high transmission speed thereby generating opportunities in the global market.

## How is the OSI model different from the TCP/IP model?

The TCP/IP networking conceptual model is an alternative to the OSI model. It divides the networking stack into four layers instead of seven, and although it is similar to the OSI model, it does not match up exactly. In the TCP/IP model, there is no "layer 7," but this is a purely semantic distinction and does not mean that networking functions differently in the two models.

The four layers in the TCP/IP model are:

1. The application layer (for protocols such as HTTP and SMTP)
2. The transport layer (for transport protocols such as TCP and UDP)
3. The Internet layer (the Internet protocol)
4. The network access layer

OSI model 7 layers:
