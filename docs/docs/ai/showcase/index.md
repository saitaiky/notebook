Here is a compilation of project showcases I completed between 2017 and 2019 during my studies in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898), [Machine learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/aws-machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd189) and [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) Nanodegree through Udacity. During my learning journey, I discovered that it's more efficient to have a clear understanding of your goals before delving into research papers or online materials. This approach allows you to grasp the end product's concept before immersing yourself in unfamiliar subjects.

I trust that this showcase of my completed projects will provide you with a quick overview, helping you identify areas of knowledge that may be of interest to you.

Looking ahead, my objective is to consistently share noteworthy projects, proof of concepts (POCs), or updates from the industry, particularly when new algorithms are introduced.
