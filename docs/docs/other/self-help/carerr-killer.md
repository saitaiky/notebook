## Career killers

- If you get your money right, prefer impact over raw output
- A promotion isn’t a reward for doing a really good job, a promotion is a recognition that you can handle more scope

### Keep investing in different
Time in the market is so much better than timing the market.

> "Time in the market" refers to the strategy of investing for the long term, rather than trying to time the market by buying and selling stocks based on short-term fluctuations in the market.

### Prioritize impact over output.
- Differentiate yourself by being impactful.
- Doing a large quantity of bug fixes doesn't necessarily mean you're making a difference. Instead, focus on preventing defects or going beyond the root cause to make a real impact.
- You don’t want to be a spot where people can differentiate between just getting something done and doing a fantastic job. (not faster/more)

### Think clearly about staying or leaving the team

Worst case: Team is toxic, deadlines is unrealistic, only take order
Best case: If your team is awesome, don’t chase for a marginal improvement.

- When evaluating a job or company, consider the quality of your manager and whether your salary is in line with industry standards.
- Promises of change should be backed up by tangible evidence, and actions should be taken to address issues rather than just words.
- Lack of growth can be a concern, and being the biggest fish in a small pond may not lead to long-term satisfaction.
- A good team should consist of talented individuals that you can learn from.
