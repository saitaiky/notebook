## History

:::infoThe two-House system
The two-House system in English Parliament, consisting of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, has its roots in medieval England. Initially, the Magna Carta of 1215 established a council of barons to consult with the king, leading to the emergence of a bicameral system where the Lords represented the nobility and clergy, while the Commons represented the broader population. Over time, through power struggles and legislative reforms, the two Houses evolved into their current form, embodying the principles of checks and balances and separation of powers within the parliamentary framework.
:::

:::infoDid Henry VIII start the protestants?
Henry VIII played a pivotal role in the Reformation in England, which resulted in the establishment of the Church of England separate from the Roman Catholic Church. But he did not actually "start" the Protestants. The Protestant Reformation began in Germany with Martin Luther's actions in 1517, when he published his "95 Theses" challenging the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.
:::

:::infoThe Habeas Corpus Act
The Habeas Corpus Act became law in 1679. This was a very important piece of legislation which remains relevant today. Habeas corpus is Latin for 'you must present the person in court'. The Act guaranteed that no one could be held prisoner unlawfullly. Every prisoner has a right to court hearing.

### Civil War & The Glorious Restoration

- Civil War (1642-1651) and the rise of Parliament
  - The English Civil War began primarily due to political power struggles between the monarchy, especially under **Charles I**(James' son ), who asserted the divine right of kings, and Parliament, which sought more power and was influenced by [Puritan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VayrvCkjANM) dissatisfaction with Charles's religious policies. Tensions escalated over issues such as taxation without parliamentary consent, disagreements on the role of the Church of England, and the autocratic tendencies of the monarchy, ultimately leading to armed conflict. Attachments: [movie 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxDqcOSWoM), [movie 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Ycp3SiOLw)
  - The country split into those who supported the king (the Cavaliers) and those who supported Parliament (the Roundheads)

- The Restoration of the monarchy (1660)
  - After the execution of **Charles I**, England became a republic known as the **Commonwealth of England**, and **Oliver Cromwell** became its Lord Protector which was effectively a monarchical position, albeit with a less hereditary and more constitutionally limited framework. Cromwell ruled until his death in 1658.
  - People wanted stability and parliament invited **Charles II** to come back in May 1660.
  - **Charles II** had no legitimate children and died in 1685. His brother James became **James II**.

  - The Glorious Revolution was a pivotal event in British history where **James II**, a Catholic king, was overthrown by a group of Parliamentarians and replaced by his daughter **Mary** and her husband, **William** of Orange, who were Protestants. Discontent with **James II**'s perceived favoritism towards Catholicism and his attempts to create a more centralized, absolutist monarchy led to fears of a Catholic autocracy. 
  - **William** was invited by a coalition of influential Protestants and parliamentary leaders to invade England and assert the throne. The revolution was relatively peaceful and bloodless, as James's army defected or failed to put up resistance, leading to his exile in France. **William** became **William III**
  - This peaceful transfer of power established **a constitutional monarchy(君主立憲制)** and the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, shaping the future of democratic governance.

    - Sir **Robert Walpole** becomes the first Prime Minister under **George I**.
    - The rebellion in Scotland led by **Bonnie Prince Charlie** (the grandson of **James II**) is because the clansmen wanted to kick back on the throne in place of **George I**.

- St. George is the patron saint of England, traditionally celebrated on April 23rd. He is most famously known for the legend of St. George and the Dragon, symbolizing courage and faith.
  - 諷刺的是，聖佐治生於現土耳其，從來沒到過英格蘭，即使有到過也大概會被「愛國分子」視為的「骯髒的」移民也。他之所以成為英格蘭的守護聖者，是十四世紀的事：時任國王喜歡聖佐治屠龍的故事所章顯的騎士精神而將他大加宣傳，所以英格蘭才有聖佐治日。 
    屠龍故事。聖佐治明明是個羅馬帝國時期的殉道者，不過他最為之稱道的「事跡」卻是一中世紀間，西方社會最著名的歷奇傳說。既是口傳的故事，版本甚多而且各有出入，但基本是：話說在北非利比亞某城附近，有條散發毒氣的惡龍，他住在城水源的湖裡，除了捕食居民外還在水裡下毒。為了安撫這條惡龍，當地居民每天都要向它放上兩隻肥羊作換取安寧。後來肥羊沒有了，居民只好用人以及小孩代替。直至某日抽籤，剛好抽中國王唯一的女兒。國王用千金買回女兒不果，只好送她入虎口。

    此時聖佐治恰好路過，聽聞此事憤怒異常，他身披代表正義的紅十字，騎士式的向惡龍突擊，手上的長槍一下直刺，把惡龍俘虜了。聖佐治把惡龍拉回城中，跟居民說，若果大家歸信基督，他便會把惡龍消滅。 惡龍之血留在地上形成了一個紅色的十字架。
