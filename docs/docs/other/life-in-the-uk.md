## History

:::infoDid Henry VIII start the protestants?
Henry VIII played a pivotal role in the Reformation in England, which resulted in the establishment of the Church of England separate from the Roman Catholic Church. But he did not actually "start" the Protestants. The Protestant Reformation began in Germany with Martin Luther's actions in 1517, when he published his "95 Theses" challenging the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.
