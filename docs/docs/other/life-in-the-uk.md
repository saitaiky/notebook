## History

:::infoThe two-House system
The two-House system in English Parliament, consisting of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, has its roots in medieval England. Initially, the Magna Carta of 1215 established a council of barons to consult with the king, leading to the emergence of a bicameral system where the Lords represented the nobility and clergy, while the Commons represented the broader population. Over time, through power struggles and legislative reforms, the two Houses evolved into their current form, embodying the principles of checks and balances and separation of powers within the parliamentary framework.

:::infoDid Henry VIII start the protestants?
Henry VIII played a pivotal role in the Reformation in England, which resulted in the establishment of the Church of England separate from the Roman Catholic Church. But he did not actually "start" the Protestants. The Protestant Reformation began in Germany with Martin Luther's actions in 1517, when he published his "95 Theses" challenging the practices and doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church.

:::infoThe Habeas Corpus Act
The Habeas Corpus Act became law in 1679. This was a very important piece of legislation which remains relevant today. Habeas corpus is Latin for 'you must present the person in court'. The Act guaranteed that no one could be held prisoner unlawfullly. Every prisoner has a right to court hearing.
