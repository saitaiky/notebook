title: Study

In modern times, the act of "study" consumes approximately twenty years of each person's life. From the age of three in kindergarten to around the early twenties after college graduation – and this doesn't even account for the growing number of individuals pursuing master's or doctoral degrees – "study" typically occupies about a quarter of one's lifespan. However, "study" and "learning" are two distinct concepts. Those engaged in "study" aren't necessarily "learning," and those who excel in "learning" don't always "study" extensively.

"Study" operates within a system's prescribed rules, while "learning" significantly influences an individual's lifelong development. In the 21st century, an era of rapid information changes, lifelong learning has become a crucial concept. With technology advancements and societal shifts, the demand for new knowledge and skills continues to evolve. In this fast-paced world, adopting a mindset and actions that embrace lifelong learning holds immense significance for personal growth and development.

## Education

### Current State

Children now often start attending pre-education institutions, such as playgroups, by the age of one. These settings provide more than just education; they also promote social interactions where children form friendships and begin to navigate the complexities of society, mirroring the real world on a smaller scale.

### Historical Evolution

Traditionally, education served as a vehicle for transferring knowledge and skills, a practice extending back to ancient times. As societies evolved from hunter-gatherers to complex civilizations, so too did educational emphases—from survival skills to the study of religion, arts, science, and philosophy. Education systems across different eras and cultures, including those of Ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and China, reflected the diverse values and ideologies of the times.

### Public Education

The Industrial Revolution brought significant changes to education, aligning it with the supply-demand of industrial skills. This period saw the expansion of public education, with governments investing in schools to meet the needs of an industrial society. Curricular reforms focused more on scientific, technical, and mathematical competencies for problem-solving and practical applications.

### Modern Transformation and Challenges

Education transformed from an elitist privilege to a means of social advancement for the broader population. Yet, this led to an increasingly exam-centric system that often fails to accommodate individual learning differences. The entry of AI and other technologies challenges the one-size-fits-all approach, enabling potential educational reforms that acknowledge and cultivate students' diverse talents and interests. By leveraging generative AI systems, we can customize teaching materials according to each student's progress. Remember, everyone has unique talents and the potential to shine.

## The Illusion of Learning

>  The brain’s need for meaningful connections is critical; without these, learning is superficial and transient.

### Wasted Efforts in Studying

Sometimes, it seems like we've tried everything, spending countless hours in the library or at school studying, but our results are disappointing. It's a clear case of mistaking dedication for effective learning. We must ask ourselves whether these hours spent are genuinely leading to learning.

### Misguided Measures of Diligence

Many believe they are diligent, spending hours at a desk studying at home or school, sometimes even pulling all-nighters. Despite these efforts, if the outcomes are unfavorable, students may become discouraged and trapped in a self-fulfilling prophecy, where their confidence dwindles, and the cycle repeats. This could be due to an illusion of learning, where the time invested does not translate to long-term knowledge retention. 

### Common Illusions of Learning 

- **Highlighters**: While students use a variety of highlighters to mark important information, psychological studies suggest that this act is often done unconsciously, as an automatic response that doesn't actually aid memory. For highlighters to be effective, the marked information must be connected to one's life experiences.
  
- **Copying Notes**: While taking notes can deepen understanding—a fact supported by evidence—the practice of meticulously copying content from provided materials is both time-consuming and inefficient. The objective should be to systematically express the knowledge you've processed, not just to rewrite it.

- **Study Groups**: Although study groups have the potential to be beneficial, they often devolve into social gatherings that waste time. A nine-hour study session might include only a few hours of actual studying, making it an inefficient way to improve memory quality.

### Embracing Meaningful Learning
The human brain is wired to look for the significance in information; we struggle to remember what lacks meaning. Just like a Go master cannot remember a nonsensical game, we must seek out the relevance in what we learn, however unrelated it may seem to our lives. True learning involves marking knowledge with our own meaning, integrating it into our lives, and using it to change our thoughts and behaviors. That's when knowledge becomes a permanent part of our memory.

## Personal Opinion

The article accurately captures common study habits that lead to the illusion of learning. It challenges readers to introspect their study methods and to shift from passive to active learning. The point about the brain’s need for meaningful connections is critical; without these, learning is superficial and transient. This piece serves as a practical reminder of the mindfulness required in education—it's not just about putting in the time, but making the time count. Overall, it's a concise and meaningful message that many students and life-long learners could benefit from.
