Everyone entering this world has a mission, a task unique to each individual. Some missions may significantly contribute to the world, while others might be more self-oriented, and some, perhaps, seemingly ordinary. However, no mission should be subject to criticism; all deserve respect. Once a person defines their mission, it becomes their life goal, shaping our sense of purpose as we journey towards that objective.

## Who we are?

When we were adolescents, we might feel a sense of confusion while searching for their identity, uncertain about their roles in their families, schools, and society. This uncertainty can lead to self-doubt and anxiety. If teens struggle to determine their identity, they might experience an identity crisis, manifested through worries about the future, feelings of inferiority, and depressive moods. 

Self-awareness, known as self-identity, plays a crucial role in shaping one's life goals. Life goals represent what one desires most in this world. If someone doesn't quite understand what they like, setting the tone and direction for their entire life becomes even more challenging in the vast expanse of life.

:::infoWhy understanding who we are is important to our life goal?
Having a clear self-awareness is a prerequisite for setting life goals. What makes a suitable life goal for oneself? It should align with your values and involve doing things you enjoy. Only then can it generate intrinsic motivation to achieve those goals. Life goals crafted to meet external expectations don’t ignite the passionate pursuit of dreams; their motivation tends to be external and short-lived. Ultimately, every individual bears the responsibility for dealing with everything in their life. Hence, life goals belong to oneself, not to others.

### Identity status theory

Identity status theory, developed by psychologist James Marcia, defines four distinct identity statuses that describe the process of identity development in late adolescence and adulthood. These statuses are based on two key dimensions: exploration (the period of identity development where one is exploring options) and commitment (the decision made about a sense of identity).

**"Exploration"** involve navigating, adjusting, and reflecting within each environment or life circumstance. As one grows, they encounter various new environments and challenges that often leave them uncomfortable or uncertain—this is the **crisis**, prompting reflection to adapt strategies in facing these new environments and challenges. **Exploration** refers to adolescents' attempts and evaluations of different identities, values, and beliefs while seeking their sense of self. 

**Commitment** signifies whether one can adhere to their crisis thinking, maintain determination to face new challenges and environments, and secure a chosen identity amidst exploration.

### 4 identity statuses

Marcia defines four identity statuses based on "**Exploration**" and "**Commitment**":

- **Identity Diffusion**: This is where an individual has not yet gone through an identity crisis (exploration) and has not made a commitment to any particular set of beliefs or values. People in this status often seem directionless and may not have a strong sense of who they are.
- **Identity Foreclosure**: Individuals here have made a commitment without going through exploration. They have often accepted values and plans laid out by parents or authority figures without questioning or exploring alternative options.
- **Identity Moratorium**: This status involves active questioning and exploration, but no commitment yet. Individuals are in the midst of an identity crisis, trying out different beliefs, values, and roles, and are open to new experiences and viewpoints.
- **Identity Achievement**: After going through a period of exploration, individuals in this status have made a commitment to a certain identity. This reflects a mature construction of identity, where an individual has resolved their identity crisis and made decisions about their personal beliefs and goals.

### Negative identity

Now, Besides the four aforementioned identity statuses, there is another known as "negative identity.", which is an intriguing concept derived from Erikson's psychosocial stage of development.

The concept of negative identity originates from Erickson's psychological and social developmental stage theory, referring to a person adopting an identity contradictory to societal expectations and mainstream values. It is essentially a form of rebellion, where an individual adopts attitudes and lifestyles that are directly in contrast to what is considered acceptable or the norm within their community.

It's important to note that a negative identity is not inherently detrimental. In some cases, it can actually be a person's way of defending their unique characteristics or exploring who they are beyond their given boundaries. However, if this identity is formed rigidly out of spite or resistance without self-reflection, it can lead to issues with self-concept and societal integration later in life.

### Factors of negative identity

Several factors may contribute to the formation of a negative identity:

- **Rebellion**: Adolescents might adopt a negative identity as a rebellion against norms and expectations, asserting their independence and autonomy. It can help them establish boundaries with their social groups and connect with peers.
- **Self-punishment**: Some adolescents may choose a negative identity as a form of self-punishment due to low self-esteem or feelings of guilt.
- **Feelings of inadequacy**: When adolescents feel unable to meet societal expectations, they may opt for a negative identity as an escape strategy.
- **Imitation**: In certain instances, adolescents may mimic negative behaviors and attitudes of family members or close friends, thereby forming a negative identity.

To avoid internalizing negative labels, actively challenge and reframe critical or unkind judgments by questioning their validity and replacing them with positive personal affirmations. Additionally, surround yourself with supportive individuals who recognize and reinforce your strengths and personal growth.

## Life 

The question "What is life?" has been asked throughout human history, echoing through the halls of philosophy, theology, biology, and, more recently, psychology. In the strictest biological sense, life is typically characterized by the ability to grow, reproduce, maintain homeostasis, respond to stimuli, adapt through evolution, and, at some point, die. 

However, when we explore the meaning of life from a psychological perspective, we delve into the realm of human consciousness, emotions, thoughts, and values. Psychologists seek to understand how people find purpose and what motivates them. This pursuit is inherently subjective, as the meaning of life can vary greatly from person to person.

Some of the psychological theories and schools of thought that attempt to address the meaning of life include humanistic psychology, positive psychology, existential psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology. In the rest of this section, we will focus on developmental psychology and talk about the topics of life goal, the quality of goal and meaning in life.


### Life Goal

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is a motivational theory developed by psychologists Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan. It focuses on the human tendency to seek out challenge and new experiences and to integrate these experiences into a coherent sense of self or to develop a more refined self-concept. The theory posits that people are driven by a need to grow and gain fulfillment.

Central to SDT are three basic psychological needs:

- **Autonomy:** The need to feel in control of one’s own behavior and goals. This implies feeling free to choose and being the initiator of one’s own actions rather than feeling pressured or controlled by external forces.
- **Competence:** The need to gain mastery of tasks and learn different skills. People need to feel effective in dealing with the environment; they need to feel they can achieve goals and handle tasks proficiently.
- **Relatedness:** The need to feel a sense of belonging, attachment, and being connected to others. People need to feel a sense of intimacy and connection with other individuals.

SDT states that the degree to which these three needs are satisfied can significantly impact one's mental and emotional well-being. Fulfillment of these needs is associated with greater intrinsic motivation (doing something for its own sake), enhanced performance, and overall well-being, whereas thwarting of these needs can lead to diminished motivation and well-being.

When it comes to deciding life goals, Self-Determination Theory is particularly important because goals that align with our inherent growth tendencies and satisfy our basic psychological needs are more likely to be pursued with intrinsic motivation, be sustainable, and lead to long-term happiness and well-being.

For example, if someone sets a goal to become a physician, and this goal is motivated by an intrinsic desire to help others (relatedness), a passion for learning about medicine (competence), and a desire to make autonomous choices in a specialized career (autonomy), they are more likely to be resilient in the face of challenges and remain dedicated to their goal over time.

Conversely, if the same goal is chosen due to external pressures such as family expectations or societal prestige, without considering one's own needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, the individual might find the path to achieving this goal less fulfilling or potentially even abandon the pursuit when faced with adversity.

Understanding and applying the principles of Self-Determination Theory can thus play a crucial role in crafting a life that is both meaningful and satisfying. It guides individuals to align their goals with their intrinsic needs, which can lead to greater personal growth, success, and psychological well-being.

### Goal Planning

Goal Setting Theory, developed by Dr. Edwin Locke in the 1960s, posits that clear, challenging goals coupled with appropriate feedback motivate individuals and lead to higher performance. The theory emphasizes that goals act as an internal driver, focusing an individual's attention, mobilizing effort, increasing persistence, and fostering the development of strategies for goal achievement.

Locke's Goal Setting Theory directly relates to the SMART criteria, an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. SMART goals operationalize Locke's principles into a practical framework to formulate objectives:

1. **Specific**: Clearly defined goals provide specific guidance on what is to be accomplished, aligning with Locke's emphasis on clear goal formulation.
2. **Measurable**: Having measurable goals allows for the tracking of progress and provides feedback, which Locke identified as crucial for motivation and adjustment of strategies.
3. **Achievable**: Challenging yet attainable goals increase motivation, resonating with Locke's finding that challenging goals lead to higher performance.
4. **Relevant**: Goals that are relevant ensure that efforts are aligned with important tasks, reflecting Locke's idea that goals are most effective when they have significance to the individual.
5. **Time-bound**: Establishing deadlines creates a sense of urgency, echoing Locke's observation that time frames sustain goal-related focus and persistence.

Together, Locke's Goal Setting Theory and the SMART criteria form a robust approach to objective formulation, increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes by ensuring goals are well-defined and strategically sound.

### Meaning in life

In our brief lives, discovering the meaning that exists in the present world can significantly impact our happiness and mental well-being. In psychology, "meaning in life" refers to something slightly different from the philosophical exploration of the "meaning of life." Philosophically, the "meaning of life" delves into the inherent significance of life itself, while in psychology, "meaning in life" explores how individuals can lead a meaningful existence. This article will introduce how psychologists comprehend the meaning in life backed by empirical evidence.

Michael Steger, a psychologist dedicated to studying life's meaning, introduced the "Meaning in Life Questionnaire, MLQ," a tool to assess an individual's perception of life's meaning. Steger's model of life's meaning primarily comprises two dimensions: **the presence of meaning** and **the search for meaning**.

The presence of meaning dimension involves an individual's perception of the existence of meaning in their life. When people feel their lives are filled with purpose, value, and significance, they experience a meaningful life. Life goals play a pivotal role in life's meaning; one's direction in life reflects their intrinsic worth. This includes goals aligned with personal values, connections with others, care, and understanding of life narratives. Pursuing a meaningful life correlates closely with mental health, happiness, and life satisfaction.

The search for meaning dimension involves actively exploring the meaning of life, including reflecting on one's purpose, values, and life narratives. It's an ongoing process as people might reassess and readjust their life goals and beliefs through different life stages and experiences. The search for meaning relates to personal growth, self-actualization, and the ability to face challenges.

Recently, psychology has reached a consensus that life's meaning comprises three aspects: 
- Significance (感到自己人生的重要性)
- Life comprehension (有著正確的生活理解)
- Purpose (擁有清晰人生目標)

These components are often central to discussions on life's meaning in the context of positive psychology and existentially oriented theories. This framework of meaning is grounded in the work of psychologists such as Viktor Frankl and has been further developed by contemporary researchers like Michael Steger.

#### Example of Significance, life comprehension and purpose

To understand these three components, let's define them and use the fictional character of Emma as an illustrative example:

1. **Significance** refers to the idea that one's life has value or worth. It encompasses the belief that life is important and matters both to the individual and potentially to others. 

 *Example*: Emma volunteers at a local animal shelter. She believes her efforts significantly impact the welfare of animals, thereby providing a sense of value and worth to her actions and her life.

2. **Comprehension**, or coherence, is about understanding one's life events and experiences, viewing life as comprehensible, consistent, and intellectually meaningful. It suggests that an individual sees their life experiences as part of a larger, understandable narrative.

 *Example*: Emma experiences a series of challenging events, but she reflects on them and sees a pattern of personal growth and resilience. This understanding helps her see her life as coherent and gives her a context for interpreting both positive and negative experiences.

3. **Purpose** is the motivational aspect of meaning; it involves having a sense of directedness and intention, goals, and a mission in life.

 *Example*: Emma's desire to contribute to environmental conservation guides her in her career choices, hobbies, and day-to-day activities. She feels that her purpose in life is to educate others about sustainability and to advocate for policy changes that protect natural resources.

#### Summary

Together, these dimensions help people to feel that life is meaningful. When individuals have a sense of significance, they feel that they matter; when they have comprehension, they feel they can make sense of life; and when they have a purpose, they have a sense of direction that propels them forward. These aspects interact and can reinforce one another to create a sense of overall meaning in an individual’s life.

It is important to note that what provides significance, comprehension, and purpose can vary widely from one person to another, and these elements can change throughout one's life as experiences and perspectives evolve. Moreover, the field of psychology continuously evolves, and different schools of thought may emphasize different aspects or propose alternative frameworks for understanding life's meaning.

## A good life

In modern empirical psychology, psychologists speculate that a fulfilling life comprises three dimensions: a happy life, a meaningful life, and a psychologically rich life. 

Let's briefly explore these life facets.

### Happy life

A Happy Life—referred to as **subjective well-being** (SWB) in psychology—involves life satisfaction, more positive emotions, and fewer negative feelings. Subjective well-being mainly stems from straightforward pleasures, like material indulgences, relishing delicious food, or residing in upscale accommodations. Hence, one's level of subjective well-being relates to personal indulgences, financial stability, time availability, and life contentment.

### Meaningful life

A Meaningful Life aligns closer to **psychological well-being** (PWB) in psychology. Carol Ryff proposed the Psychological Well-being Model in 1989, measuring PWB across six dimensions. These dimensions not only reveal the diversity of well-being but also emphasize individual development and psychological maturity.

- **Self-acceptance** involves positively evaluating oneself, including accepting past experiences and present traits. 
- **Positive relations with others** entail nurturing meaningful connections and displaying care, compassion, and love. 
- **Autonomy** signifies independence in thoughts and actions, even under societal pressure. 
- **Environmental mastery** refers to effectively coping with environmental changes and deriving satisfaction from them. 
- **Purpose in life** denotes a clear understanding of life's meaning and goals, enabling setting objectives. Personal growth represents continual self-improvement and pursuit of self-fulfillment.

A meaningful life embodies dreams and altruistic goals beneficial to society. Pursuing meaningful life goals involves overcoming obstacles, not necessarily associated with hedonistic happiness, as it entails facing failures and setbacks. Pursuing meaningful goals demands high self-discipline and often involves sacrificing indulgences. The sense of purpose stems from contributing to society and fostering a better future.

### Psychologically rich life

In the end, a psychologically enriched life is intertwined with life experiences. Someone with a psychologically enriched life has had numerous life-changing events that continually alter their perspective on life. Their life trajectory becomes more legendary compared to the average person. 

For instance, a single mother who had a child at sixteen faced five extremely challenging years in financial hardship. Yet, it was precisely during this time that she developed the idea of caring for underprivileged children. Through her persistent efforts, she eventually established a social startup a decade later, which grew into a successful business. 

`Not every psychologically enriched life necessitates prior hardship, but it's about having rich life experiences`. Life isn't rigid; it's filled with various stimuli and experiences, positive or negative. I believe even a backpacker wandering through South America leads a psychologically enriched life. 

### Summary

A happy life, a meaningful life, and a psychologically enriched life make up a good life, but most people don't wholly possess these three. A successful entrepreneur might find life happy and meaningful but may not feel psychologically enriched because their life lacks significant stimuli or transformative events. Conversely, a young person traveling for work may feel psychologically enriched as their days are filled with excitement. However, they might find this life lacking in meaning and frequently struggle with practical issues, leading to a lack of happiness.

## Life is a journey 

Judging a person's heroic status solely based on the outcomes of their actions can be highly problematic when looked at through two contrasting psychological lenses: **the performance-oriented mindset** and **the fixed mindset**. The performance-oriented mindset prioritizes end results and the validation from others, often glossing over the effort, learning, and moral integrity involved in the process. Similarly, those with a fixed mindset believe abilities are static, which can lead to viewing success as an affirmation of inherent talent and failure as a lack of it.

The concepts of **the mastery-oriented mindset** and **the growth mindset** offer a more constructive approach. A mastery-oriented mindset focuses on the inherent value of the effort and process of learning, rather than merely the end result. A growth mindset, championed by psychologist Carol Dweck, is characterized by the belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.

Instead of lionizing individuals solely for their successes, embracing a growth or mastery-oriented approach encourages us to celebrate continuous improvement, learning from experiences, and resilience. These mindsets help us to..
- Recognize that the path to mastery is iterative and that failure is often a stepping stone to success. 
- Reduce anxiety and fear of failure, as setbacks are viewed as learning opportunities.
- Appreciate the journey of growth and not just the destination.
- Create a more positive self-image and healthier self-esteem based on intrinsic motivation rather than external validation.

:::infoThe mastery-oriented and growth mindset lead to a positive life
By exalting these qualities, we foster an environment where individuals are motivated to persist, innovate, and contribute to the greater good without the fear of failing to achieve a specific outcome. This not only makes our lives more positive but also creates a society that values growth, learning, and moral action over mere results.

:::infoNeither success nor failure is permanent
Would you prefer life to be straightforward or as vibrant as a rainbow? Neither success nor failure is permanent. Since nothing is eternal, how can success or failure be absolute? Life is a journey, a roller coaster ride. When riding a roller coaster, is it more fun to stay at the top or the bottom? The most thrilling moments are, of course, when you zoom down from the top and soar right back up!

## Conclusion 

At an individual level, meaning can be found in various facets of life such as relationships, work, personal achievements, spirituality, and the pursuit of knowledge. While the search for life's meaning is a deeply personal journey, psychology tries to provide frameworks to understand and support that search. The search for meaning can be intrinsic to the human experience and can significantly impact mental health and well-being.

Ultimately, psychology does not offer one definitive answer to the meaning of life but instead provides a variety of perspectives and tools that can help individuals explore, define, and pursue their own sense of purpose.
