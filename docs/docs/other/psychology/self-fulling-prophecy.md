title: Self-fulling prophecy
---

To do something well, to achieve a goal, perhaps your beliefs play a more crucial role than the abilities you possess. I believe that each of you reading this article holds a goal, a dream. Ask yourself: Do you truly believe you can achieve it? Belief in oneself is often the first step toward success.

Many of us have experienced instances in our daily lives where we slowly begin to believe in what we excel at or what we lack. For instance, during primary school, if a math teacher constantly belittled your abilities, labeling you as poor in math or lacking talent, gradually you might genuinely believe you have no aptitude for numbers, deeming yourself a "math dummy." Conversely, if a high school teacher praised your Chinese essay, suddenly your confidence in Chinese writing soared. You perceived it as your forte, fostering unwavering confidence in this realm throughout high school and perhaps even beyond.

## Self-fulling prophecy

The above tendency in human thought is termed by psychologists as the "self-fulfilling prophecy." Human beliefs influence their behavior, and the actions taken reinforce these beliefs. Let's further explain this phenomenon using the below examples.

### Example

Imagine a student named Alex who receives a negative review on a math test from their teacher. The teacher comments, "You don't seem to have a knack for math," implying a lack of natural ability. Alex reads the review and internalizes the teacher's belief, starting to think, "I'm just not good at math."

As a result of this new self-perception, Alex's confidence in math wanes. Anxiety might increase during tests and homework sessions, leading to poorer performance – not because of an inherent inability, but because of the doubt planted by the teacher's words. Alex might also lose motivation to practice, thinking it won't make much of a difference.

This series of events confirms the initial bad review—Alex's grades in math do not improve or may even decline, thus the teacher's initial assessment seems justified, though it was the negative belief itself that triggered the downward spiral.

The self-fulfilling prophecy cycle is in effect: the teacher's expectation negatively influenced Alex's belief about their own ability, which in turn altered Alex's behavior and academic performance, reinforcing the original prophecy.

### A bad cycle

You should be able to feel that this is a vicious cycle, repeating itself over and over. As a result, Alex perpetually believes he's a "mathematic idiot" and never tries to change. That's the power of self-fulfilling prophecy. Have you had similar experiences? Another example is how parents often belittle their children, making them never believe they can do things well, ultimately leading to poor performance. When you're laughed at the first time you play basketball, you start thinking you're not good at it, maybe even avoiding it altogether. Not believing you can become wealthy, you lose interest in finance, and consequently, you'll never become wealthy.

I'm not sure if you all like the NBA, but you probably know only about 300 players can enter this elite basketball realm. Each of them was a top star in high school, college, or their national teams, so why do we only have one Kobe Bryant, one Michael Jordan, one LeBron James, one Stephen Curry? Why do other shining players become average in the NBA? 

Beyond physicality and circumstances, a major psychological factor is: `do you believe in yourself`? If you do, you'll train hard and improve; if you don't, you won't strive and will regress. It all begins with your thoughts and beliefs about yourself, all linked to self-fulfilling prophecy.

Kobe Bryant had a great saying: "If you are afraid to fail, then you are probably going to fail."

Believing in yourself leads to hard work, yielding good results that reinforce your belief in yourself.

### The word "Talent" can be harmful

When there's a talent show on TV, the buzz is all about "talent," "creativity," and "innovation." But what do these terms really mean? And aren't we too narrow in how we define them?

Let's take a closer look. Talent, for example, often gets pigeonholed. Mention "talent" and most folks picture a stunning piano solo, a mesmerizing dance, or a powerful vocal performance. 

But talent stretches far beyond the stage lights of music and the arts. Consider creativity—it's not just about whipping up brilliant ideas or painting like a modern-day Picasso. The Kaufman Domains of Creativity Scale broadens the view, showcasing that creativity infuses everything from day-to-day life to academic achievements, from technical innovations to artistic expressions.

So, here's the scoop: talent isn't exclusively about belting out tunes or hitting the right notes. It's also in crafting a killer article, building strong relationships, managing our emotions, or acing an exam. We've all got talents bubbling beneath the surface—sometimes, it just takes a bit of soul-searching to bring them to light.

Never sell yourself short by thinking you're not talented. Recognizing your self-worth is the first step toward uncovering your unique strengths. Remember, the dazzle of talent is not a sudden burst of genius—it's the result of hard work, countless hours of practice, and learning from those bumps along the road.

So, next time you're watching those talent show superstars, tip your hat to the sweat and tears they've poured into their craft. And don't forget, we all have diverse talents waiting to shine. Finding what makes your heart race, setting your sights on your dreams, and grabbing opportunities head-on—that's the real secret to letting your talent soar.

## How to be talented

Have you ever wondered what it takes to be considered 'talented' in a particular field? Swedish psychologist and researcher K. Anders Ericsson, renowned for his work on expertise and human performance, has a compelling answer to this question. His research reveals that the notion of talent is frequently overvalued and that, through dedicated and systematic practice, nearly anyone can reach outstanding expertise.

In the book "[Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](https://amzn.eu/d/8gxgUZ8)" that he co-authored with Robert Pool, Ericsson contends that what is often seen as 'natural talent' is, in fact, the fruit of consistent, intense practice over time. He explains that deliberate practice is not just any routine activity but a highly disciplined and structured one aimed specifically at enhancing performance. This type of practice includes focused skill repetition, immediate feedback, recognizing and rectifying errors, and challenging oneself beyond one's current abilities.

We'll delve into the myths surrounding the 10,000-hour rule, IQ test, understand why mere hours of practice aren’t sufficient, learn the correct way to practice, and discuss the limitations of deliberate practice.

### The 10,000-Hour Rule

**The 10,000-Hour Rule** gained popularity through Malcolm Gladwell's book "[Outliers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell-ebook/dp/B002RI9PKO/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26R9KS5KIIV4Q&keywords=outliers+by+malcolm+gladwell&qid=1702468459&s=books&sprefix=Outliers+ma%2Cstripbooks%2C81&sr=1-1)", proposing that around 10,000 hours of practice are required to master a skill. However, Ericsson himself clarified that this interpretation simplifies his findings. While research did indicate that experts practiced their craft for about 10,000 hours on average, it's not the sheer volume of practice but the nature of it that's pivotal for success.

Instead, just racking up hours is inadequate. Deliberate practice is particular—it's purposeful, systematic, and incorporates continuous feedback loops. 

The flaw in the 10,000-hour rule is that it disregards the quality, intentionality, and methodology of practice. Spend 20,000 hours on casual chess games, for instance, and you may still not reach grandmaster status without incorporating deliberate practice. In contrast, focused and strategic practice might propel someone to expert levels much faster.

### IQ test is a curse

K. Anders Ericsson argued that the way most people view "natural talent" and intelligence is flawed. IQ tests, which are designed to measure a person's cognitive abilities, often lead to labeling individuals based on their scores. This labeling can result in what's known as a fixed mindset, where people come to believe that their intelligence and abilities are innate and unchangeable.

An IQ test is designed to measure a person's intellectual abilities and potential. It typically assesses various cognitive skills like logical reasoning, pattern recognition, mathematical ability, and language comprehension. However, IQ tests have limitations and do not encompass the entire spectrum of human intelligence, such as emotional, social, or practical intelligence. Moreover, an individual's score can be influenced by numerous factors including educational opportunities, cultural background, and test-taking experience, making it an incomplete measure of one's full capability or potential for learning and problem-solving in real-world situations.

The "curse" of the IQ test, in this view, is that it can discourage people from engaging in deliberate practice by making them think their abilities are capped by their IQ score. If someone believes they are not "naturally" intelligent or talented in a particular area, they may be less inclined to put forth the effort to improve through deliberate practice. Conversely, those with high IQ scores might become complacent, assuming their intelligence will lead to success without the same level of effort.

Thus, the mindset encouraged by categorizing people based on IQ tests detracts from the more important and egalitarian message of deliberate practice: that with effort, strategy, and perseverance, individuals can significantly improve their performance in various domains.


## Deliberate Practice 

Deliberate practice, a term synonymous with psychologist K. Anders Ericsson, has been widely discussed in relation to achieving expertise. Although aspects of this theory may spark debate, the core idea stands firm: structured, purpose-driven practice can significantly boost performance.

Key elements of deliberate practice include:

- **Purposeful and Precise Objectives:** Every session of deliberate practice comes with clear and detailed goals. Knowing exactly what you're working towards is crucial.
- **Focused Attention:** It's essential to be fully engaged during practice, fine-tuning details and actively seeking improvement, rather than simply going through the motions.
- **Feedback:** Without regular input—from a coach, mentor, or self-assessment—to highlight errors and suggest adjustments, progress is hampered.
- **Stretching Boundaries:** True deliberate practice isn’t particularly enjoyable since it pushes you to your limits and requires tasks that are somewhat out of reach.
- **Developing Mental Maps:** As you immerse yourself in deliberate practice, you form complex and clear mental representations of the skills necessary for your domain, improving anticipation, strategy, and room for advancement.
- **Consistency and Persistence:** It’s the steady, relentless effort over time that leads to skill enhancement. This gradual progression demands ongoing discipline and passion.

Mastery isn't about clocking in countless hours but rather about the thoughtful, dedicated quality of those hours. Practice has to be strategic and should follow principles and techniques conducive to peak performance.

### Feedback

To me, the most important part of deliberate practice is to receive high-quality feedback. Thus, here's a guideline on how to get good feedback based on Ericsson’s principles:

- **Clear Goals**: Before seeking feedback, have a clear understanding of what specific skill or component of a skill you are practicing. Knowing exactly what you aim to improve helps in obtaining focused feedback.
- **Expert Coach or Mentor**: Try to get feedback from an expert or a skilled mentor in the field. They are better equipped to provide accurate, diagnostic feedback that can guide your improvement.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Aim for prompt feedback soon after your performance while the details are still fresh. This helps in making immediate corrections and understanding where you went wrong.
- **Actionable Feedback**: Good feedback should not just highlight what is wrong; it should provide you with information on how to make improvements. It should be specific and actionable.
- **Frequent and Regular**: Deliberate practice involves getting feedback regularly. The more frequently you receive feedback, the more opportunities you have to adjust and improve.
- **Objective Measures**: Feedback should be as objective as possible to avoid biases. Using measurable outcomes from your performance can help in giving precise feedback.

Remember, while feedback from others is invaluable, developing self-assessment skills is also a key part of deliberate practice. Learning to evaluate your own progress can enhance your ability to adjust your practice even when external feedback isn't available.

### Limitations

Despite the transformative potential of deliberate practice, we must also acknowledge that other elements play roles in achieving high levels of expertise, such as personal interest, innate abilities, and even serendipity. There are several critiques and restrictions to consider:

- **Starting Age:** The age when one commences practice can dictate potential expertise levels, as early development is crucial in certain fields like sports and music.
- **Physical Predispositions:** For some disciplines, physical traits cannot be fully compensated for by practice alone (e.g., height in basketball) and may afford an innate advantage.
- **Individual Variances:** Genetic and cognitive differences can affect the efficiency of learning and applying new skills, meaning the path to expertise varies person to person.
- **Diminishing Returns:** Beyond a certain skill level, the benefits of additional practice taper off—something often seen in elite athletes and performers.
- **Innate Interest and Motivation:** A natural inclination toward a field can factor into one's willingness to engage in the intense practice needed for expertise, and it can impact the efficacy of practice.

## My thoughts

In this post, we’ve explored potential roadblocks to personal growth, such as misconceptions around the IQ test, the 10,000-Hour Rule, and limited views on talent. The self-fulfilling prophecy theory highlights the power of belief—when you believe in yourself, your actions will naturally align you closer to your goals.

Deliberate practice is a key method for self-improvement. Remember, it’s essential to seek continual feedback to gauge your progress. While you may start with what seems like short-term knowledge, requiring extra effort, once you've internalized the concepts (mental representation) and honed your skills, you'll find yourself practicing with greater ease and speed than ever before. 

Embracing these ideas can truly elevate your journey towards mastery, arming you with a clear, strategic, and knowledge-driven approach. So, what’s your plan for enhancing your next practice session?💪
