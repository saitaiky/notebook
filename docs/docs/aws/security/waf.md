AWS WAF is a web application firewall (**layer 7**) that lets you configure rules that allow, block, or monitor (count) web requests to below 4 services based on conditions that you define. 
- **an Amazon CloudFront distribution**
  - Your rules run in all AWS Edge Locations located around the world close to your end-users. This means security doesn’t come at the expense of performance. Blocked requests are stopped before they reach your web servers. 
- **an Amazon API Gateway REST API**
- **an Application Load Balancer**
  - When you use AWS WAF on Application Load Balancer, your rules run in the region and can be used to protect internet-facing as well as internal load balancers.
- **an AWS AppSync GraphQL API**

As new applications are developed, Firewall Manager makes it simple to bring them into compliance by imposing a common set of security rules. You can use AWS WAF to create custom rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, and rules that are designed for your specific application.

You only need to configure your firewall rules once and the service will apply them to all of your accounts and resources.

Firewall Manager comes in handy whenever you want to safeguard your **entire organization rather than just a few specific accounts and resources**. It also offers centralized monitoring of DDoS attacks throughout your organization.

### Behaviors

At the simplest level, AWS WAF lets you choose one of the following behaviors:

- **Allow all requests except the ones that you specify** – This is useful when you want Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, Application Load Balancer, or AWS AppSync to serve content for a public website, but you also want to block requests from attackers.
- **Block all requests except the ones that you specify** – This is useful when you want to serve content for a restricted website whose users are readily identifiable by properties in web requests, such as the IP addresses that they use to browse to the website.
- **Count the requests that match the properties that you specify** – When you want to allow or block requests based on new properties in web requests, you first can configure AWS WAF to count the requests that match those properties without allowing or blocking those requests. This lets you confirm that you didn't accidentally configure AWS WAF to block all the traffic to your website. When you're confident that you specified the correct properties, you can change the behavior to allow or block requests.
