Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed database service offered by AWS that simplifies the process of setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud. It allows you to choose from various database engines such as **MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle**, and **Microsoft SQL Server**, and provides automated tasks like hardware provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, and scaling. 

Important points to remember:
- You can only enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it
- You can’t disable encryption on an encrypted DB instance
- *You can’t have an encrypted Read Replica of an unencrypted DB instance or an unencrypted Read Replica of an encrypted DB instance*
- You *can’t restore an unencrypted backup or snapshot to an encrypted DB instance*.
- To copy an encrypted snapshot from one region to another, you must specify the KMS key identifier of the destination region.

## Underlying instance type

- There are currently over 18 instance sizes that you can choose from when resizing your RDS MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server instance. 
- For Amazon Aurora, you have 5 memory-optimized instance sizes to choose from.

## Behaviour

### Replication

- These 2 are the most important points to remember for SysOps exam
  - Multi-AZ follows **synchronous replication** and spans at least two Availability Zones within a single region. 
  - Read replicas follow **asynchronous replication** and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or Cross-Region

### Backup without outages

Amazon RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases. 

- **Single-AZ DB**: Creating this DB snapshot on a Single-AZ DB instance results in a brief I/O suspension that can last from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size and class of your DB instance. 
- **Multi-AZ DB**: **Multi-AZ DB instances are not affected by this I/O suspension(outages)** since the backup is taken on standby.
## Feature

### Encryption in flight

In the **DB parameter groups** - You can allow only SSL connections to your RDS for PostgreSQL database instance by enabling the `rds.force_ssl` parameter ("0" by default) through the parameter groups page on the RDS Console or through the CLI.

:::infoFor application doesn't accept certificate chains
A root certificate that works for all regions can be downloaded from the AWS website. It is the trusted root entity and should work in most cases but might fail if your application doesn’t accept certificate chains. If your application doesn’t accept certificate chains, download the AWS Region–specific certificate from AWS.

### Encryption at rest

You can only enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it, not after the DB instance is created. However, because **you can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted DB snapshot**, you can effectively add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance. That is, you can create a snapshot of your DB instance and then create an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot, and thus you have an encrypted copy of your original DB instance.

### TDE for Oracle

Oracle Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), a feature of the Oracle Advanced Security option available in Oracle Enterprise Edition. This feature automatically encrypts data before it is written to storage and automatically decrypts data when the data is read from storage.

In order to enable Transparent Data Encryption for your RDS, you need to 
1. Creating an **option group** and add Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) option
2. Associating the option group to the DB instance
3. Creating database encryption key (DEK) on the database and enable encryption on the database

:::infoWhat is option group?
Some DB engines offer additional features that make it easier to manage data and databases, and to provide additional security for your database. Amazon RDS uses **option groups** to enable and configure these features. An *option group* can specify features, called options, that are available for a particular Amazon RDS DB instance.

### RDS Proxy

> TL;DR - RDS Proxy as a connection pool for handling overwhelmed connections / unpredictable surges in database traffic.
 
Amazon RDS Proxy enhances database efficiency and scalability for applications, including modern serverless ones, **by pooling and sharing connections to the database**. This helps prevent memory and compute exhaustion caused by **frequent opening and closing of connections**. 

RDS Proxy reduces failover times, integrates with AWS Secrets Manager and IAM for secure access, and efficiently manages variable workloads, allowing multiple application connections to share resources and regulating connection openings. Enabling RDS Proxy requires no code changes or additional infrastructure management, making it a seamless solution for optimizing database performance and application availability.

### Enhanced Monitoring

Enhanced Monitoring for RDS provides the following **OS level metrics** which are free memory, active memory, swap free, processes running, file system used. It is useful when you want to see how **different processes or threads** on a DB instance use the CPU.

:::infoNormal CloudWatch metrics vs Enhanced Monitoring
A hypervisor creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). Using a hypervisor, an instance can support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing memory and CPU. **CloudWatch** gathers metrics about CPU utilization from the **hypervisor** for a DB instance. In contrast, **Enhanced Monitoring** gathers its metrics from an agent on the DB instance.

You might find differences between the CloudWatch and Enhanced Monitoring measurements, because the hypervisor layer performs a small amount of work. The differences can be greater if your DB instances use smaller instance classes. In this scenario, more virtual machines (VMs) are probably managed by the hypervisor layer on a single physical instance.

### PITR

![rds-article](/img/aws/database/rds/rds-article.webp)

The automated backup feature of Amazon RDS enables **point-in-time recovery (PITR)** of your DB instance. When automated backups are turned on for your DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically performs a full daily snapshot of your data (during your preferred backup window) and captures transaction logs (as updates to your DB Instance are made). 

When you initiate a point-in-time recovery, transaction logs are applied to the most appropriate daily backup in order to restore your DB instance to the specific time you requested.

## Scalability

### Read scalability

![read replica](/img/aws/database/rds/read-replica.png)

Source: [Working with read replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html)

Important points:

- Any updates made to the primary DB instance are **asynchronously** copied to the read replica. So both these options are incorrect.
- Writing to tables on a read replica can break the replication
- If the value for the `max_allowed_packet` parameter for a read replica is less than the `max_allowed_packet` parameter for the source DB instance, replica errors occur. 

## Availability 

### Maintaince downtime

Upgrades to the **database engine level** require **downtime**. Even if your RDS DB instance uses a Multi-AZ deployment, both *the primary and standby DB instances are upgraded at the same time*. This causes downtime until the upgrade is complete, and the duration of the downtime varies based on the size of your DB instance.

Source: [How do I minimize downtime during required Amazon RDS maintenance?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-required-maintenance/)
### Handle failover

![Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments](/img/aws/database/rds/multi-az-deployments.png)

Source: [Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/rds/features/multi-az/)

When you provision an RDS Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). It provides enhanced availability and durability for RDS database (DB) instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads.

- Amazon RDS *automatically initiates a failover* to the standby, in case the primary database fails for any reason  
- RDS applies OS updates by performing maintenance on the standby, then promoting the standby to primary, and finally performing maintenance on the old primary, whic

## Limitations for encrypted DB instance

The following limitations exist for Amazon RDS encrypted DB instance:

- **You can only enable encryption for an Amazon RDS DB instance when you create it**, not after the DB instance is created. However, because you can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted DB snapshot, you can effectively add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance. That is, you can create a snapshot of your DB instance and then create an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot, and thus you have an encrypted copy of your original DB instance.
- **[important] You can't disable encryption on an encrypted DB instance.**
- **[important] You can't have an encrypted Read Replica of an unencrypted DB instance or an unencrypted Read Replica of an encrypted DB instance.**
- **[important] You can't restore an unencrypted backup or snapshot to an encrypted DB instance.**
- **To copy an encrypted snapshot from one region to another, you must specify the KMS key identifier of the destination region.** This is because KMS encryption keys are specific to the region in which they are created in. - The source snapshot remains encrypted throughout the copy process. AWS Key Management Service uses envelope encryption to protect data during the copy process.

## OS patch upgrade

**On the Amazon RDS console** to view if your RDS instance needs OS patching. Periodically, Amazon RDS performs maintenance on Amazon RDS resources. Maintenance most often involves updates to the DB instance's underlying operating system (OS) or database engine version. Updates to the operating system most often occur for security issues and should be done as soon as possible.

Maintenance items require that Amazon RDS take your DB instance offline for a short time. Maintenance that require a resource to be offline include scale compute operations, which generally take only a few minutes from start to finish, and required operating system or database patching. Required patching is automatically scheduled only for patches that are related to security and instance reliability. Such patching occurs infrequently (typically once every few months) and seldom requires more than a fraction of your maintenance window.

DB instances are not automatically backed up when an OS update is applied, so you should back up your DB instances before you apply an update. You can view whether a maintenance update is available for your DB instance by using the RDS console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API. If an update is available, it is indicated by the word Available or Required in the Maintenance column for the DB instance on the Amazon RDS console.


## Troubleshooting

### Error when Backup retention set to 0

RDS retains backups of a DB Instance for a limited, user-specified period of time called the retention period, which by default is 7 days but can be set to up to 35 days. 

There are several reasons why you may need to set the backup retention period to 0. For example, you can **disable automatic backups immediately** by setting the retention period to 0. If you set the value to 0 and receive a message saying that the retention period must be between 1 and 35, check to make sure **you haven’t setup a read replica for the instance**. **Read replicas require backups for managing read replica logs**, thus, you can’t set the retention period of 0.
