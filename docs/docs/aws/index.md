Hello, I'm Sai. I've compiled this AWS section to document the knowledge I gained while preparing for the AWS SysOps, Developer, and Solutions Architect associate certifications. If you find any inaccuracies of the content, kindly notify me through GitHub/Feedback section.

While obtaining certifications is an achievement, the journey itself offers valuable insights. Preparation involves not just testing existing knowledge but also gaining hands-on experience with various AWS services. For example, you'll explore security-related services like AWS Inspector, AWS Config, and AWS Trusted Advisor, understanding when to use each. You'll tackle practical questions, such as setting up a VPC for internet-connected instances while keeping others isolated, ensuring file system integrity when creating AMIs, and achieving "Write Once, Read Many" (WORM) compliance for sensitive data storage. This preparation equips you to grasp these concepts and implement them effectively with AWS.

## Certifications

By far, I hold three associate certifications: SysOps, Developer, and Solutions Architect (SA). I feel that SA is the most accessible, requiring a basic grasp of service usage and system design from an architectural perspective. Developer delves deeper, emphasizing implementation using serverless services, data streams, SQS, and CodePipeline.

SysOps is the most challenging. It involves not only troubleshooting issues that Architects or Developers might encounter but also ensuring high security, cost optimization, continuous monitoring, and compliance with client and owner requirements. Given its broader scope compared to the other two, SysOps is understandably the toughest, often requiring multiple attempts for success according to various online resources like Reddit or Udemy.

## Is it worth it?

### Certification Value

People nowadays excel in exams and certifications. However, not all certifications carry the same weight in the job market. For instance, some certifications don't automatically boost trust or salary prospects. Completing the AWS certification raised questions about its true worth. Does certification equal competence? Does it enhance or detract from one's professional value? 

To me, because these certifications significantly complemented my work and deepened my understanding of both AWS and system operations, I would definitely say `it helps to make me to be a better architect`. That said, when to get the certification utility depends on your career path, circumstances, and seizing opportunities.

### Expertise vs. Certification

Certifications don't guarantee expertise. Expertise means effectively solving domain-specific issues. Certifications offer a basic understanding and system control. Real expertise combines these with practical experience and problem-solving abilities. Graduates should gain comprehensive knowledge, basic proficiency in a field, and work on capstone projects for professional readiness. Despite people's proficiency in certifications, the expertise gap remains. True expertise lies in the ability to tackle core challenges.
