## What is Caching?

- A cache is a rapid data storage layer used to store a subset of data that is frequently accessed, allowing faster retrieval than accessing the primary storage location.
- Caching efficiently reuses previously fetched or computed data.

## How does Caching work?

- Cached data is typically stored in fast access hardware like RAM (Random-access memory) and may involve software components.
- Caching aims to enhance data retrieval performance by reducing the necessity to access the slower primary storage.

## Caching Overview

- RAM and In-Memory Engines: Caching is vital for improving data retrieval performance and reducing costs at scale. It's especially beneficial in read-heavy workloads with high request rates.
- Applications: Caches find applications in various technology layers, including operating systems, networking, web applications, and databases. They significantly reduce latency and enhance IOPS in applications such as Q&A portals, gaming, media sharing, and social networking.
- Design Patterns: Dedicated caching layers in distributed computing environments allow systems to run independently from the cache, ensuring scalability and resilience.
- Caching Best Practices: Implementing caching requires considerations like data validity, TTLs, and high availability. In-Memory engines like Redis can provide the necessary resilience and data storage capabilities.

Caching optimizes data access and performance across a wide range of applications, making it a critical concept in modern computing.
