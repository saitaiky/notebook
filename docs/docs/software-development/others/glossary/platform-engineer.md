# Platform engineer

The software development process is complex and often involves multiple teams with different roles and responsibilities. Platform engineers work to streamline the software development process by providing a standardized platform that developers can use to build and deploy applications quickly and reliably.


Platform engineering refers to the process of designing, building, and maintaining the underlying infrastructure, tools, and frameworks that enable software development teams to create and deploy applications. It involves creating a platform that is stable, scalable, and flexible enough to meet the needs of a wide range of users, including developers, operations teams, and end-users. Below are the key sections that describe platform engineering in more detail:

## Definition of Platform Engineering:
Platform engineering is the discipline of designing, building, and maintaining the underlying technology infrastructure, frameworks, and tools that enable software development teams to create and deploy applications. It aims to create a stable and scalable platform that can support a wide range of applications, from small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise-level applications.

## Key Elements of Platform Engineering:
Some of the key elements of platform engineering include:

- Infrastructure Design: The design of the underlying hardware, networking, and storage infrastructure that supports the platform.
- Platform Architecture: The overall architecture of the platform, including the various components and services that make up the platform.
- Tooling: The various tools and frameworks that are used to build and deploy applications on the platform.
- Security: Ensuring that the platform is secure and that applications running on the platform are protected from security threats.
- Scalability: Designing the platform to be scalable, so it can handle a growing number of users and applications.
- Monitoring and Metrics: Monitoring the platform's performance and collecting metrics to identify and resolve issues.

## Role of a Platform Engineer:
A platform engineer is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the platform infrastructure and tools that enable software development teams to create and deploy applications. Some of the key responsibilities of a platform engineer include:

- Designing and building the platform infrastructure, including the hardware, networking, and storage components.
- Developing and maintaining the platform architecture, including the various components and services that make up the platform.
- Developing and maintaining the tooling that is used to build and deploy applications on the platform.
- Ensuring that the platform is secure and that applications running on the platform are protected from security threats.
- Designing the platform to be scalable, so it can handle a growing number of users and applications.
- Monitoring the platform's performance and collecting metrics to identify and resolve issues.

## Benefits of Platform Engineering:
Some of the key benefits of platform engineering include:

- Improved Developer Productivity: By providing a stable and scalable platform, developers can focus on building applications, rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
- Faster Time-to-Market: With a platform that is designed to support rapid application development and deployment, teams can bring new applications to market more quickly.
- Better Collaboration: By providing a common platform that is shared across development teams, platform engineering can improve collaboration and communication between teams.
- Lower Costs: By providing a common platform and tooling, platform engineering can reduce the costs associated with building and maintaining separate infrastructure for each application.

In summary, platform engineering is a critical discipline that enables software development teams to create and deploy applications more quickly and efficiently. By designing and maintaining a stable, scalable, and secure platform infrastructure and tools, platform engineers can improve developer productivity, reduce costs, and bring new applications to market more quickly.


## DevOps VS Platform Engineer

:::info TL;DR
Platform engineers are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the underlying infrastructure, tools, and frameworks that enable software development teams to create and deploy applications. Platform Engineering is a more recent concept, building on the foundation of SRE engineering. 

DevOps, on the other hand, is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that emphasize collaboration and communication between software development teams and IT operations teams, with the goal of delivering software more quickly and reliably. DevOps as a concept was introduced in 2009 by Patrick Debois and Andrew Shafer at the Agile conference.

While both roles are involved in creating and deploying software, platform engineers focus more on the underlying infrastructure, while DevOps focuses on the overall software development process.

:::info SRE
SRE, or Site Reliability Engineering, was pioneered by Google in the early 2000s to address operational challenges in managing large-scale, complex systems. Google developed SRE practices and tools, such as the Borg cluster management system and the Monarch monitoring system, to improve the reliability and efficiency of their services.

Here are the key differences between platform engineers and DevOps:

### Platform Engineer

- Focuses on the underlying infrastructure, frameworks, and tools that enable software development teams to create and deploy applications.
- Designs, builds, and maintains the platform infrastructure, including hardware, networking, storage, and various components and services that make up the platform.
- Develops and maintains tooling that is used to build and deploy applications on the platform.
- Ensures that the platform is secure, scalable, and stable enough to support a wide range of applications.
- Typically works closely with developers and operations teams to ensure that the platform meets the needs of the organization.

### DevOps

- Focuses on the entire software development lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations.
- Emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams to ensure that software is developed and deployed efficiently and effectively.
- Automates processes wherever possible, using tools like continuous integration and continuous delivery to speed up the software development process.
- Monitors applications in production to identify and resolve issues quickly.
- Typically works closely with developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders to ensure that software is delivered on time, within budget, and meets the needs of the organization.

In summary, while platform engineers focus on the underlying infrastructure and tools that enable software development, DevOps focuses on the entire software development lifecycle, emphasizing collaboration, automation, and monitoring to ensure efficient and effective delivery of software.
